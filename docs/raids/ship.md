## Shipped

Once the client has paid the second half of the project, move the deal to `Shipped`.

## Finish a Raid

Once you’ve delivered on your Scope of Work, please have a <span class="cleric">Cleric</span> communicate directly with the Client to ensure final payment has been made.

When payment is received, the very first step is to deposit 10% of that Raid total back to the War Chest.

This can be done by sending wxDAI or WETH (or any whitelisted token) to the [DAO Treasury](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0x181ebdb03cb4b54f4020622f1b0eacd67a8c63ac) (0x181e...63ac) and posting in <span class='channels'>#did-a-thing</span> with the transaction hash. This process is automated with Raid Guild’s Smart Escrow product.

While we can not force you to send 10% spoils back to the War Chest Raid Guild will remember your actions until you make amends with the DAO. If you do not have a compelling reason for refusing to pay 10% to the DAO, you stand to be stripped of your Raid Guild Membership.

Next, be sure to archive your Raid Channel by sending it to Valhalla. Any guild member can send a raid channel to Valhalla (archive) by using the `/to-valhalla` command in the channel you wish to archive.
