-   If the client loses confidence in the raid party at any time, they may `Lock` the remaining funds in escrow so that they cannot be released or withdrawn.
-   If the client has not released funds once a milestone has been completed, the raid party may `Lock` the remaining funds in escrow.

In both cases, the `Lock` triggers the arbitration provider (i.e., [Leâš”DAO](https://lexdao.org/)) to review the dispute. Based on their review, the arbitration provider will decide which party should receive what amount of funds, and will send a transaction to the escrow contract that will transfer the appropriate amounts to each party. In the case of a non-escrow disagreement, there are emerging ADR services or else trying ```#find-a-lawyer``` or seek a referral on their servers.
