## Find your place

### Discord

Most of the Raid Guild magic takes place on our Discord server. 

You can join the Raid Guild Discord [here](https://discord.gg/rGFpfQf). When you have been assigned a `Raid Guild Member` role, then you will be able to access all of Raid Guild’s internal channels. Others – successful cohort members, newcomers, clients – will have access to fewer channels. Refer to the [channel guides](../discord/channels) for reference.

We ask that users of our Discord server keep it polite. Please read our notes on [Discord Etiquette](../discord/etiquette). 

If you are **not** a Raid Guild member, we recommend you check out “[Become An Apprentice](../membership/become-an-apprentice)” first. If admitted to the Raid Guild as an apprentice, you’ll have the opportunity to prove your talent and level up in the DAO as you complete tasks, unlocking access to new private channels. This will allow you to take on bigger Raids and contribute to shaping the Guild as we know it today.

### Hire Raid Guild

Find out how to [hire Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/hire), and read more on our [commission process & smart escrow system](../raids/commission-process).  

### Join Raid Guild

If you haven't already introduced yourself, the first place you’ll want to make yourself known is <span class='channels'>#tavern</span>, where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.

From here, you’ll need to work your way into the Guild as part of a cohort:

1. [Apply for onboarding](https://www.raidguild.org/join)
2. Read up on what to expect if you [become an apprentice](../membership/become-an-apprentice) 
3. Prove yourself through your work on [Raids](../raids/join-a-raid), [RIPs](../operations/rips), and cohort projects to qualify to [become a member](../membership/become-a-member). 
4. Get a [member to champion](../membership/champion-a-member) you to enter the Guild!  
5. Get paid through [DAOhaus](../how-to/daohaus-guide)
6. Vote on [Guild proposals](../operations/proposal-types)
7. Make connections, buidl stuff and have fun!

The more issues you tackle to improve the Guild, the quicker you’ll get recognized, gain membership and become part of the Guild.
