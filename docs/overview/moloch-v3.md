### Moloch V3

Raid Guild utilizes the Moloch V3 framework. A great overview of Moloch V3 and its benefits can be found [here](https://guide.daohaus.club/).

Moloch was popularized due to its Minimum Viable DAO design and the advent of "ragequit" - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the War Chestâ€™s assets. After using DAOhaus V2 for several years RaidGuild migrated to DAOhaus V3 which offers additional extensibility and updated UX.

The TL;DR of Moloch V3 is that shares and loot are ERC-20 tokens and governance can be adjusted by votes after summoning. The need for minions no longer exists as the DAO can perform arbitratry transactions. Treasuries and vaults are just wrapped [safes](https://app.safe.global/).
