[Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/) is the premier design and dev agency of the Web3 ecosystem. 

## What we do

Raid Guild is a Decentralized Collective of Mercenaries Ready to Slay Your Web3 Product Demons.

No demon is too large or smol for Raid Guild. Weâ€™ve launched everything from DeFi dashboards, dApps, and tokens to new DAOs and public good projects. See our trophies in the [Raid Guild portfolio](https://portfolio.raidguild.org/).

## What we believe

We believe that DAOs will power the future of work. 

We believe in Web3 and are here to build it, use it, and propagate it.

The profits from our work will be used to fund development of open source tooling and public goods. We will share the learnings from our experiments and open source our processes for the community to learn and build from.

*If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.*

## Who we are

Raid Guild consists of a diverse group of worldwide talent, a fellowship of the best builders, designers, and hustlers in the space.
