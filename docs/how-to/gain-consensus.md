A DAO is a democratically organised organisation, with votes being critical to decision making. 

This is the process: 

1. Find an issue worth voting on (e.g. payments proposals, project decisions) 
2. Discuss at a meeting with others, gain allies, send some DMs
3. Collect a soft consensus using Discord polls   
4. If needed, put the voting on chain using a DAOhaus proposal on your relevant DAO, without funds or use snapshot
