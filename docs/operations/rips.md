Raid Guild Improvement Proposals, commonly referred to as “RIPs”, are an invaluable piece to ensuring that Raid Guild operates at its fullest capacity 24/7.  

RIPs are generally focused on Guild internal operations, but in some cases, RIPs have resulted in the Guild building open-source tools for the wider web3 ecosystem.  

[Smart Invoice](https://smartinvoice.xyz/) is a great example, as it began development as an internal tool for Raiders to set up an escrow for payment from their clients.  

If this excites you, we encourage you to keep reading! 

### Funding

To receive funding for a Raid Guild Improvement Proposal (RIP), we suggest you [get a soft consensus from the DAO](../how-to/gain-consensus) before putting anything on chain. 

The best way to do this is as follows:

-   Create an issue on the [RIPs Repo](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RIP&template=rip-request.md&title=) detailing why it benefits the DAO and how it will be executed.
-   Add the new issue to the [RIP Requests](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/1) Project (or ask a keeper).
-   Share that request in Discord under the <span class='channels'>#rip-discussion</span> Guild HQ Forum.

By following these steps, your proposal will receive far more feedback and have a much higher chance of being passed.

If you don’t yet have the talent you need to execute the RIP, make sure to drop a link to your proposal along with a brief TL;DR to the <span class='channels'>#who-is-available</span> channel and outline the different roles you need for the RIP. Share the proposal during the weekly Roundtable for additional comments and feedback.

Once you have completed the preceding steps, double check to make sure you and your team have everything you need to make an official proposal to the DAO.

Refer to the process outlined on the [Proposal Types](./proposal-types) page for help to make proposal for funding for your RIP.

### Deliverables

To improve accountability and insight in the RIP outcome we're experimenting with an escrow flow where the DAO signs of on the expected deliverable. This means the finalisation of the Raid will be signed-of by the DAO. To make sure expectations are aligned we recommend clearly stating what will be the deliverables of the Raid.

### Escrow
#### Escrow options

Multiple options for escrow exist, for instance Smart Invoice, a shared minion or Gnosis Safe. 

Requirements:
- The DAO needs to co-sign for releasing funds to the RIP party
- The ability for the DAO to -if needed- withdraw funds 
#### Escrow process

1. After a RIP is accepted we expect the address of a shared minion or escrow details to be in the proposal
2. When the RIP proposal is accepted, funds are transferred to the escrow solution
3. RIP party executes the RIP
4. RIP is put to 'Review' status (and discussed during RT)
5. After review a DAO proposal is made to release the funds from minion/escrow
6. DAO votes and transfers funds upon approval of the proposal

#### Disputes

Dispute resolutions is dependant on the selected escrow method. For example, in the case of Shared Escrow an escalation flow involving LexDAO exists.

> Note: Since we're experimenting with the escrow flow, another setup for escrowing funds can be proposed
