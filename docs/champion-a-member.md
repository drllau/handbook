Raid Guild grows organically, adding new members as individual existing members deem appropriate and champion them in. Our championing process relies both on the Champion being a good judge of who is a good fit for the Guild as well as on the Champion’s reputation within the Guild being at stake.

In addition to reputation, to ensure that we are only bringing the highest quality new members, Champions must also put down $RAID as a semi-financial stake.

We also recognize that Championing involves a degree of mentorship. To encourage and compensate Champions for their mentorship of new members, Champions of successful new members will receive a $RAID reward in addition to receiving back their original stake.

## $RAID Staking 

To champion a new member, a Champion must stake $RAID. The stake amount depends on the type of applicant:
* The required stake amount is 25,000 $RAID if the applicant has finished one of the Raid Guild Cohorts
* The required stake amount is 50,000 $RAID if the applicant has not finished one of the Raid Guild Cohorts, or if the Champion is from the same cohort season as the applicant.

The Champion will receive their stake back if the apprentice meets the [success criteria](./champion-a-member#success-criteria) outlined below.

Upon staking the applicant shall receive the <span class="apprentice">Apprentice</span> status, which the Guild is responsible for ensuring has the necessary permissions to meet the success criteria.

## $RAID Reward

Champions receive a reward of 12,500 $RAID if their new member meets [success criteria](./champion-a-member#success-criteria) outlined below. Note that this has been reduced from the previous figure of 25,000 $RAID.

## Success Criteria

New members are successful when they contribute to the Raid Guild community, bring in value to the Guild, and earn income for themselves.

After 60 days of Apprenticeship and up to 120 days, the applicant may be considered for membership if they have achieved the following criteria:

1. Successfully join at least one [Raid](./join-a-raid) or [RIP](./rips). This includes Raids or RIPs still in progress, provided the member is in good standing on that project.
2. Attend at least two [Guild meetings](./community-meetings), including Round Table and Raider Roundup.
3. Demonstrate shared values with the Guild (at the discretion of the DAO).

## Championing Process

Follow these steps to Champion a new member:

1. Stake the appropriate amount of $RAID by transferring the $RAID to the `New Member Championing` minion at this address: `0xd6343fde84e9a2197faa2ae1d6affdb46675856d`.
2. Create an issue on the [RIP repository](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs) using the `Championships` issue type. Track further progress on the [Champion Board](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/3).
3. Include the Blockscout transaction URL as well as other information about the applicant in this issue.
4. Help the new member get onboarded and engaged in Guild activities.
5. Record the applicant’s activity related to the new member success criteria.
6. Have the applicant submit a membership proposal to the DAO and include information on the success criteria in the proposal description.
   This is how the Guild will validate their success.
7. If/once the applicant has met the new member success criteria, make a proposal (within 2 weeks) requesting your original stake plus your reward from the `Incentives/Bounties` safe. Your proposal should include a link to the member proposal to show success from Apprentice to Member. 

## Process Deadlines

Two deadlines have been added to prevent delays in the process that may result in confusion over the accomplishment of the success criteria and unclear accounting.

1. Apprentices must wait 60 days to request membership, but may not wait more than 120 days. This allows for a flexible apprenticeship period but with a definite end.
2. Champions have 2 weeks from passing of the apprentice's member proposal to request their reward.
